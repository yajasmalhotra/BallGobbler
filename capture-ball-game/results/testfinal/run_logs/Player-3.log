WARNING: The communication API versions between Unity and python differ at the minor version level. Python API: 1.0.0, Unity API: 1.2.0 Python Library Version: 0.17.0 .
This means that some features may not work unless you upgrade the package with the lower version.Please find the versions that work best together from our release page.
